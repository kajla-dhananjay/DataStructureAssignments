## Sorting Checker Assignment

### Task 

Your task is to to edit the files `src/lib/src/sorter.cpp` and `src/lib/include/sorter.hpp` to implement the following:

- insertion_sort
- merge_sort

Note that you might need to add more functions to the classes for some sorting algorithms, you're free to do so as long as you don't use libraries other than the ones provided to you within the project.
