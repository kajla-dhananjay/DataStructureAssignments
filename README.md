# Data Structure Assignments

Some data structure assignments that I curated along with checker scripts for the same. Will keep adding to it.

## A1: Sorting

This assignment consists of implementing popular sorting algorithms. To complete the assignment: 

- Complete the functionality in `A1_Sorting/lib/include/sorter.cpp` and `A1_Sorting/lib/include/sorter.hpp`. 
    - You're free to add functions if needed but not libraries
- Run `cd A1_Sorting && make` and wait for a while
- Your result will be displayed at the end along with performance testing plots.
